Revision history for DBIx-Class-Atomic

0.002

Documentation improvements.

Fixed dumb bug where it didn't actually return a row from
atomic_update_or_create.

Added an extra guard in atomic_update_or_create to detect where the DBIC
schema doesn't correspond to the database schema, and croak if so.

(TODO: add more extensive testing to break this guard.)

0.001

Initial release.
